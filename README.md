Interactive Map Application
Overview
This project is a Java-based interactive map application designed to allow users to visualize and interact with geometric shapes overlaid on a map image. Utilizing object-oriented principles and graphical user interface components, this application provides a dynamic and interactive way to display and manipulate geometric objects.

Features
Display of a background image representing a map.
Creation and manipulation of various geometric objects like rectangles and points.
Interactive elements where objects can be selected, moved, and their properties such as color can be changed dynamically.
Implementation of algorithms to detect if a point is within a certain geometric object.
A custom user interface for viewing the map and objects, and for displaying information about selected objects.

Technical Details
Language: Java
Graphics: AWT and Swing for rendering shapes and handling user interactions.
Design: Utilizes abstract classes and inheritance to define geometric objects with common and specific behaviors.
Data Handling: Reads geometric object data from an input file and translates it into visual elements on the screen.

Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide a practical visualization tool that can be used in various domains such as geography, urban planning, or any field that requires the mapping of data points to a visual representation. It demonstrates the use of Java for creating rich graphical user interfaces and handling user interactions.
